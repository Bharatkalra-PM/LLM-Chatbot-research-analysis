       "[Document(page_content=\"Fireside Ventures, the venture capital (VC) firm that backs consumer startups, reaped massive benefits from its investments in Mamaearth, the first-ever company to go for an initial public offering (IPO) from its portfolio. In total, Fireside invested around Rs 30 crore in Mamaearth and made over Rs 550 crore in returns as it diluted its stake for the offer-for-sale (OFS) component.\\n\\nIn another transaction, days later, it sold more shares and booked a massive 4,500 percent profit on its investment in Honasa Consumer, Mamaearth’s parent company. Fireside had paid Rs 7.33 for each share in Mamaearth, and the company’s share price closed the last trading session at Rs 436.15 apiece on December 26, signalling more upside for the VC firm as it still holds around 5 percent in Mamaearth.\\n\\nSo, what worked for the Bengaluru-based investor? We caught up with Dipanjan Basu, co-founder and partner, Fireside Ventures, who said the VC firm identifies and invests in companies that align with what public market investors reward later. Fireside ensures portfolio companies have a head of finance/chief financial officer from the early days, the investor even employs a person within the VC firm who oversees people functions at its portfolio companies.\\n\\nSpeaking on the recent corporate governance lapses that have cropped up within the wider startup ecosystem, Basu said, “While the tactical answer is that there could have been financial fraud, the eventual answer is different.”\\n\\n“There is not enough delegation, not enough people who have the right voices and there are no systems to call out red flags as and when they appear. A bulk of this happens because there is too much power in the founders’ hands. These are classic organisational issues, which then manifest into a financial issue.

These are companies that have crossed Rs 100 crore in revenue and are now aiming for the Rs 500-crore mark. The team, led by Kannan Sitaram Co-founder and Partner Fireside Ventures, identifies various values like brand building, customer retention, omnichannel, people, governance and environmental social governance (ESG) across our companies,” Basu said.\\n\\n“For Fireside, it is founder-first and planet-first. For tough decisions, we will always listen to the founders first…especially when the company is not doing well,” Basu said.\\n\\nHe added that Pipa Bella, a jewellery brand that was sold to Nykaa did not yield desired returns for Fireside Ventures but is now growing well under Nykaa’s umbrella. Given its relation with Pipa Bella’s founder Shuchi Pandya, the investor now works alongside Pandya at Fireside Ventures.\\n\\nIncluding Pandya, Fireside has a total of about 27 members who back founders building consumer companies.\\n\\nWithin Fireside, unlike several other VC firms, the partners keep switching between roles at companies, Basu said. “I may be involved with one company but also look at another partner and say, ‘Hey, you might be a better fit in this company at this stage.

It takes a board seat in each of the companies it backs, as it generally picks up about a 20 percent stake in the company.\\n\\nIn the six years of its existence, it has backed 39 companies including Boat, The Sleep Company, Slay Coffee, Nat Habit and several others.\\n\\nInvestment plans going forward\\n\\nAccording to Basu from Fireside, the base of internet/smartphone users in India will double from 200 million to 400 million in three years as more non-metro users switch from feature phones.
